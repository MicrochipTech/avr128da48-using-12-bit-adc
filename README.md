Using 12-bit ADC for Conversions, Accumulation, and Triggering Events

This repository contains examples of bare metal source code for ADC as described in TB document from Microchip.
The repository contains an Atmel Studio Solution with multiple projects inside. Make sure you have the necessary tools:

	1. ATmega AVR DA device (or evaluation board)
	2. Atmel Studio
	3. ATmega AVR DA Device Packs

The following examples are inside this repository:
	1. ADC Differential Conversion
	2. ADC Event Triggered
	3. ADC Free Running
	4. ADC Sample Accumulator
	5. ADC Single Conversion
	6. ADC Temperature Measurement
	7. ADC Window Comparator

The source code is compatible with the following devices: AVR128DA28, AVR128DA32, AVR128DA48, and AVR128DA64.
